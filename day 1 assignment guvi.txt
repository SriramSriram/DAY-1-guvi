DAY 1:
Qn 1 :
Difference between http1 and http2?
		http1															http2
It is slower and less reliable										It is much faster and highly reliable 
Single TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) connection is use to send and receive one request/response	Using Multiplexing almost every request/ response is carried away by only one TCP
Authentication is unsafe since the username and passwords are being transmitted in clear text 		Using TLS feature it is better equipped with the authentication of the network
Provides slower delivery of webpages as compared to the http2						Using multiplexing the results are faster along with less sensitive to network delays.
	
	

Qn 2:
Blog about object and its internal representation in javascript?
Object:
•	Object is a important datatype in JavaScript. It is a nonprimitive datatype where the values(many) are stored in a continuous manner.
•	The values containing inn the object is stored in the memory location using a reference number.
•	The object values are stored in name: value pairs.
•	Eg: var student={name: “Sriram”; age:22; place: “Chennai”};
Representation of objects:

Object literal:
•	Its an easy way of representing the name: value pair inside a curly braces{}
•	Eg1 : var hotel= {hotelName:”Udupi”; foodType:”veg&non-veg”; location:”Chennai”}
•	Eg2 :
•	var hotel= {};
hotel.hotelName=”Udupi”;
hotel.foodType=”veg&non-veg”;
location= ”Chennai”;

above example is simple creating the empty object and finally adding the other properties to it.
Object keyword new:
•	It is nothing but creating an new object() and then adding all the other properties to it
•	Eg: 
Var hotel = new.object();
hotel.hotelName=”Udupi”;
hotel.foodType=”veg&non-veg”;
 location= ”Chennai”;

object constructor type
•	Constructor is a function and it is used to create multiple objects using main object.
•	Eg:
•	
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
this.name = name;
this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
console.log(car1.name); 
console.log(car2.name);
